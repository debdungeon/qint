Building RPMs

   Starting with version 0.99, it is possible to build binary RPMs directly
   from the source tarball, so there's no longer a need to provide a separate
   set of source and binary RPMs. You will need RPM 3.0 or higher in order to
   build a binary RPM. Execute the following command:

    rpm -ta maildrop-2.2.0.tar.bz2

   The binary RPM will be built with a customized configuration (userdb,
   GDBM, and quota enhancements enabled). Afterwards, simply execute rpm -i
   to install it. That's it.

   With RPM 4.1 (Red Hat 8.0) use the 'rpmbuild' command instead of rpm:
   rpmbuild -ta maildrop-2.2.0.tar.bz2

   If you would like to change the RPM build options, move
   maildrop-2.2.0.tar.gz to your SOURCES directory, extract the file
   maildrop.spec, move it to your SPECS directory, customize it if necessary,
   then build from the spec file.

   maildrop includes documentation in HTML, as well as traditional man pages.
   The HTML versions may also be found at

Installation

   See [3]INSTALL for installation information. If you are using an RPM-based
   Linux distribution, you can install build a binary RPM directly from the
   source code.

Using maildrop with sendmail

   Maildrop can be easily used as sendmail's local delivery agent, instead of
   procmail. Here is the suggested entry for sendmail.cf, courtesy of Eric J.
   Schwertfeger <ejs@bfd.com>:

  
 Mlocal,         P=/usr/local/bin/maildrop, F=lsAw5:/|@SPfhn, S=10/30, R=20/40,
                 T=DNS/RFC822/X-Unix,
                 A=maildrop -d $u

   You may also consider including the D, F, and M flags as well.
