                                  maildrop 2.0

   Version 2.0 introduces a new pattern matching engine that uses the PCRE
   library, that uses a completely different syntax. However, very few
   changes should be required to upgrade existing maildrop recipes to the new
   syntax.

   Review the maildropfilter manual page which has been revised to document
   the new pattern matching syntax. The legacy pattern matching engine is
   still available by setting MAILDROP_OLD_REGEXP to 1. See also the
   "Conversion of maildrop 1.x pattern to 2.0" section in the manual page,
   for more information.

                                  maildrop 1.2

   If you're upgrading from maildrop 0.74 or earlier, read the next section,
   then come back here.

   Starting with maildrop 1.2, the installation directories will use the GNU
   layout. It might be painful, but it has to be done. The previous
   installation directories were based on two years' worth of legacy code,
   and had to go, in order for maildrop to be able to be shipped in a
   distribution.

   The installation layout used by maildrop 1.1 and earlier:

   /usr/local/lib/maildrop/bin - binaries.

   /usr/local/lib/maildrop/man - manual pages.

   /usr/local/lib/maildrop/html - HTML documentation.

   /usr/local/bin - soft links to binaries in /usr/local/lib/maildrop/bin.

   Starting with maildrop 1.2, maildrop will use the GNU installation layout:

   {bindir} - binaries.

   {mandir} - manual pages.

   {datadir}/maildrop - scripts and HTML documentation.

   For scripts that are intended to be invoked from the shell command line,
   there will be soft links from {bindir} to {datadir}/maildrop.

   This means that the default installation layout will be as follows:

   /usr/local/bin - binaries.

   /usr/local/man - manual pages.

   /usr/local/share/maildrop - scripts and HTML documentation.

   maildrop 1.2 also installs development libraries. They are optional, and
   can be removed after installation, if not needed. The development files
   will be installed in {libdir} and {includedir}. The default installation
   layout would be:

   /usr/local/include - include files.

   /usr/local/lib - libraries.

Manually upgrading from earlier versions of maildrop

   The recommended upgrade path is to first manually remove the previous
   version of maildrop, then install the new version of maildrop afterwards.

Upgrading using the packaged RPM build script

   The packaged RPM build script now installs maildrop in /usr/bin, instead
   of the previous /usr/local/bin. This is because the build script now uses
   the platform build defaults.

   The new script also puts manual pages into a separate RPM, as well as
   creating a separate devel RPM with the libraries and include files.

                                 maildrop 0.75

   Read this document if you're upgrading from 0.74, or earlier.

   Maildrop 0.75 includes several bug fixes to the userdb scripts, however
   the main change in 0.75 is a different installation layout.

   Maildrop versions 0.74 and earlier used the following installation layout.
   Typically, the following files were installed in the directory
   /usr/local/bin:

   /usr/local/bin/dotlock
   /usr/local/bin/maildrop
   /usr/local/bin/reformail
   /usr/local/bin/reformime - core maildrop binaries

   /usr/local/bin/maildirmake - soft link to maildrop.maildirmake
   /usr/local/bin/maildrop.maildirmake

   /usr/local/bin/makedat - soft link to maildrop.makedat
   /usr/local/bin/maildrop.makedat - optionally installed if GDBM/DB support
   is selected during configuration

   /usr/local/bin/deliverquota - soft link to maildrop.deliverquota
   /usr/local/bin/maildrop.deliverquota - optionally installed if maildir
   quota support is selected during configuration

   /usr/local/bin/makeuserdb - soft link to maildrop.makeuserdb
   /usr/local/bin/pw2userdb - soft link to maildrop.pw2userdb
   /usr/local/bin/userdb - soft link to maildrop.userdb
   /usr/local/bin/maildrop.makeuserdb
   /usr/local/bin/maildrop.pw2userdb
   /usr/local/bin/maildrop.userdb - optional scripts installed if userdb
   support is selected during configuration
   /usr/local/man - various manual pages were installed underneath this
   directory.

   There was a reason why I initially decided to use this particular
   installation layout. At least, I think I had one.

   Although I haven't received any comments on this layout, I believe that
   this layout is not very convenient, and may be confusing. So I've decided
   to try a new installation layout starting with maildrop 0.75. My goals
   were:

     * A logical, straightforward layout
     * Try to avoid breaking any existing stuff
     * Allow easier management. For example, permit a quick and painless way
       to roll back to a previous release of maildrop (for some future
       releases, of course).

   Maildrop 0.75 and onward will use the following installation layout by
   default:

   /usr/local/lib/maildrop/bin - all base and optional binaries will be
   installed here

   /usr/local/lib/maildrop/man - all manual pages will be installed here

   /usr/local/lib/maildrop/html - all HTML versions of manual pages, and
   additional documentation, will be installed here.

   Soft links in /usr/local/bin. The installation script will install the
   following soft links in the /usr/local/bin directory. The following soft
   links will point to the binaries that are installed in the
   /usr/local/lib/maildrop/bin directory:

   /usr/local/bin/maildrop
   /usr/local/bin/reformail
   /usr/local/bin/reformime
   /usr/local/bin/dotlock
   /usr/local/bin/maildirmake
   /usr/local/bin/makedat
   /usr/local/bin/deliverquota
   /usr/local/bin/makeuserdb
   /usr/local/bin/pw2userdb
   /usr/local/bin/userdb

   Configuration switches that select whether or not certain optional
   binaries are installed will remain the same.

   Basically, anything that expects to find things in /usr/local/bin should
   continue to work.

   However, when you are ready to install a later release of maildrop, you
   can simply move your current /usr/local/lib/maildrop directory before
   installing the later release. In the event that you need to back out to
   the previous version of maildrop, you can do that simply by removing the
   newly installed /usr/local/lib/maildrop directory, and moving the previous
   one in its place.

   I think that this is a definite improvement from the previous layout.

Upgrading from maildrop 0.74 and earlier

   If you compile and install maildrop 0.74 from the original source code
   tarball, you can proceed to configure, compile, and install maildrop as
   usual. You can use the --prefix option to the configure script to change
   the main installation directory from /usr/local/lib/maildrop to something
   else. If your previous version of maildrop was not installed in the
   default directory /usr/local/bin, you can use the --bindir option to the
   configure script to specify your non-default installation directory.

   make install should be able to create the correct soft links. After
   running make install, or make install-strip, you will need to manually
   perform the following steps:

     * Manually remove any old maildrop binaries from /usr/local/bin, such as
       maildrop.makedat, maildrop.deliverquota, and others. Anything
       maildrop.* can be removed.
     * New manual pages are installed underneath the main
       /usr/local/lib/maildrop directory. You will need to remove old manual
       pages from the /usr/local/man directory. Find all files underneath
       /usr/local/man that begin with "maildrop". You will also need to look
       for a corresponding soft link that points to each manual page.
     * Configure your man(1) command to search /usr/local/lib/maildrop/man
       for manual pages, which is where maildrop's manual pages are now
       installed. In most cases, you need to simply add the path
       /usr/local/lib/maildrop/man to the MANPATH environment variable. If
       you use the Bourne or Bash shells, simply add the following code to
       /etc/profile:

       MANPATH="/usr/local/lib/maildrop:$MANPATH"
       export MANPATH

Upgrading binary RPMS for Red Hat Linux

   I recommend that instead of using the rpm -U command to upgrade your
   binary RPM, you should first remove the old maildrop rpm, using rpm -e,
   then install the new RPM using rpm -i.

   The binary RPM takes care of setting the MANPATH variable. Also, note that
   the binary RPM installes the HTML version of manual pages, plus additional
   documentation, in /usr/doc instead of /usr/local/lib/maildrop/html.
