.SH "NAME"
deliverquota - deliver to a maildir with a quota
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 13
\fBdeliverquota\fR [\-c] [\-w\ \fIpercent\fR] {\fImaildir\fR} {\fIquota\fR}
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP

\fBdeliverquota\fR
delivers mail to a
\fImaildir\fR
taking into account any software\-imposed quota on the maildir\. This manually\-enforced quota mechanism is described in the
\fI\fBmaildirquota\fR(7)\fR\&[1]
and
\fI\fBmaildirmake\fR(1)\fR\&[2]
manual pages\. Instead of setting up your mail server to deliver the message directly to a maildir, configure the mail server to run the
\fBdeliverquota\fR
program in order to deliver the message, and specify the location of the maildir as the argument to
\fBdeliverquota\fR\.
.PP
The second argument to
\fBdeliverquota\fR
is optional\. If present,
\fIquota\fR
specifies a new quota setting for this maildir\. Specifying
\fIquota\fR
is equivalent to running
\fI\fBmaildirmake\fR(1)\fR\&[2]
with the
\fB\-q\fR
option\. The second argument to
\fBdeliverquota\fR
is considered obsolete, and may be removed in the future\.
.PP

\fBdeliverquota\fR
reads the message from standard input and delivers it to
\fImaildir\fR\.
\fImaildir\fR
may specify a path directly to a maildir folder, not the main
\fImaildir\fR
(as long as the folder was created by the
\fI\fBmaildirmake\fR(1)\fR\&[2]
command\.
.PP
The
\fB\-c\fR
option automatically creates the maildir, and all missing parent subdirectories (as \'\fBmkdir \-p\fR\')\. This option should be used with caution\.
.PP
The
\fB\-w N\fR
option places a warning message into the maildir if the maildir has a quota setting, and after the message was successfully delivered the maildir was at least
\fIN\fR
percent full\. The warning message is copied verbatim from
\fI@sysconfdir@/quotawarnmsg\fR
with the addition of the "Date:" and "Message\-Id:" headers\. The warning is repeated every 24 hours (at least), until the maildir drops below
\fIN\fR
percent full\.
.SH "RETURN CODE"
.PP

\fBdeliverquota\fR
delivers the message to the maildir and terminates with exit code 0 if the message can be delivered without going over quota\.
.PP
If the maildir is over its specified quota,
\fBdeliverquota\fR
terminates with exit code 77 (EX_NOPERM)\.
