       addresses - formats for Internet mail addresses

IINNTTRROODDUUCCTTIIOONN
       A mmaaiill aaddddrreessss is a string of characters containing @.

       Every mail address has a llooccaall ppaarrtt and a ddoommaaiinn ppaarrtt.  The domain part
       is everything after the final @.  The local part is everything  before.

       For example, the mail addresses

          God@heaven.af.mil
          @heaven.af.mil
          @at@@heaven.af.mil

       all  have  domain  part hheeaavveenn..aaff..mmiill.  The local parts are GGoodd, empty,
       and @@aatt@@.

       Some domains have owners.  It is up to the owner  of  hheeaavveenn..aaff..mmiill  to
       say  how  mail messages will be delivered to addresses with domain part
       hheeaavveenn..aaff..mmiill.

       The domain part of an address is interpreted without regard to case, so

          God@heaven.af.mil
          God@HEAVEN.AF.MIL
          God@Heaven.AF.Mil

       all refer to the same domain.

       There  is  one  exceptional address that does not contain an @: namely,
       the empty string.  The empty string  cannot  be  used  as  a  recipient
       address.   It  can  be used as a sender address so that the real sender
       doesn’t receive bounces.

QQMMAAIILL EEXXTTEENNSSIIOONNSS
       The qqmmaaiill system allows several further  types  of  addresses  in  mail
       envelopes.

       First,  an  envelope  recipient  address without an @ is interpreted as
       being at _e_n_v_n_o_a_t_h_o_s_t.  For example, if  _e_n_v_n_o_a_t_h_o_s_t  is  hheeaavveenn..aaff..mmiill,
       the address GGoodd will be rewritten as GGoodd@@hheeaavveenn..aaff..mmiill.

       Second, the address ##@@[[]] is used as an envelope sender address for dou‐
       ble bounces.

       Third, envelope sender addresses of the form _p_r_e@@_h_o_s_t--@@[[]] are  used  to
       support  variable  envelope  return  paths  (VERPs).   qqmmaaiill--sseenndd  will
       rewrite  _p_r_e@@_h_o_s_t--@@[[]]  as  _p_r_e_r_e_c_i_p==_d_o_m_a_i_n@@_h_o_s_t   for   deliveries   to
       _r_e_c_i_p@@_d_o_m_a_i_n.   Bounces  directly  from  qqmmaaiill--sseenndd  will  come back to
       _p_r_e@@_h_o_s_t.

       Here are some suggestions on choosing mail addresses for the  Internet.

       Do  not  use  non-ASCII  characters.   Under RFC 822 and RFC 821, these
       characters cannot be used in mail headers  or  in  SMTP  commands.   In
       practice, they are regularly corrupted.

       Do  not  use ASCII control characters.  NUL is regularly corrupted.  CR
       and LF cannot be used in some combinations and are  corrupted  in  all.
       None of these characters are usable on business cards.

       Avoid spaces and the characters

          \"<>()[],;:

       These  all  require quoting in mail headers and in SMTP.  Many existing
       mail programs do not handle quoting properly.

       Do not use @ in a local part.  @ requires quoting in mail  headers  and
       in  SMTP.   Many programs incorrectly look for the first @, rather than
       the last @, to find the domain part of an address.

       In a local part, do not use two consecutive dots, a dot at  the  begin‐
       ning,  or a dot at the end.  Any of these would require quoting in mail
       headers.

       Do not use an empty local part; it cannot appear in SMTP commands.

       Avoid local parts longer than 64 characters.

       Be wary of uppercase letters in local parts.  Some mail  programs  (and
       users!)     will     incorrectly     convert    GGoodd@@hheeaavveenn..aaff..mmiill    to
       ggoodd@@hheeaavveenn..aaff..mmiill.

       Be wary of the following characters:

          $&!#~‘’^*|{}

       Some users will not know how to feed these characters safely  to  their
       mail programs.

       In  domain names, stick to letters, digits, dash, and dot.  One popular
       DNS resolver has, under the banner of security, recently begun destroy‐
       ing  domain  names  that  contain  certain  other characters, including
       underscore.  Exception: A dotted-decimal IP address in  brackets,  such
       as  [[112277..00..00..11]],  identifies a domain owned by whoever owns the host at
       that IP address, and can be used safely.

       In a domain name, do not use two consecutive dots, a dot at the  begin‐
       ning, or a dot at the end.  This means that, when a domain name is bro‐
       ken down into components separated by dots, there are no  empty  compo‐
       nents.

       Always  use  at  least  one  dot  in a domain name.  If you own the mmiill
       domain, don’t bother using the address rroooott@@mmiill;  most  users  will  be
       unable to send messages to that address.  Same for the root domain.

       Avoid domain names longer than 64 characters.

       RFC  821  defines  an encoding of mail addresses in SMTP.  For example,
       the addresses

          God@heaven.af.mil
          a"quote@heaven.af.mil
          The Almighty.One@heaven.af.mil

       could be encoded in RCPT commands as

          RCPT TO:<God@heaven.af.mil>
          RCPT TO:<a\"quote@heaven.af.mil>
          RCPT TO:<The\ Almighty.One@heaven.af.mil>

       There are several restrictions in RFC 821 on the  mail  addresses  that
       can be used over SMTP.  Non-ASCII characters are prohibited.  The local
       part must not be empty.  The domain part must be a sequence of elements
       separated by dots, where each element is either a component, a sequence
       of digits preceded by #, or a dotted-decimal IP address  surrounded  by
       brackets.   The  only  allowable  characters in components are letters,
       digits, and dashes.  Every component must (believe it or not)  have  at
       least  three characters; the first character must be a letter; the last
       character must not be a hyphen.

       RFC 822 defines an encoding of mail addresses in certain header  fields
       in a mail message.  For example, the addresses

          God@heaven.af.mil
          a"quote@heaven.af.mil
          The Almighty.One@heaven.af.mil

       could be encoded in a TToo field as

          To: God@heaven.af.mil,
            <@brl.mil:"a\"quote"@heaven.af.mil>,
              "The Almighty".One@heaven.af.mil

       or perhaps

          To: < "God"@heaven .af.mil>,
            "a\"quote" (Who?) @ heaven . af.  mil
            , God<"The Almighty.One"@heaven.af.mil>

       There  are  several restrictions on the mail addresses that can be used
       in these header fields.   Non-ASCII  characters  are  prohibited.   The
       domain  part  must  be  a sequence of elements separated by dots, where
       each element either (1) begins with [ and ends  with  ]  or  (2)  is  a
       nonempty string of printable ASCII characters not including any of

          \".<>()[],;:

       and not including space.
