       qmail-queue - queue a mail message for delivery

       qqmmaaiill--qquueeuuee  reads  a  mail  message  from descriptor 0.  It then reads
       envelope information from descriptor 1.  It places the message into the
       outgoing queue for future delivery by qqmmaaiill--sseenndd.

       The  envelope  information  is an envelope sender address followed by a
       list of envelope recipient addresses.  The sender address  is  preceded
       by  the letter F and terminated by a 0 byte.  Each recipient address is
       preceded by the letter T and terminated by  a  0  byte.   The  list  of
       recipient  addresses  is terminated by an extra 0 byte.  If qqmmaaiill--qquueeuuee
       sees end-of-file before the extra 0 byte, it aborts without placing the
       message into the queue.

       Every  envelope recipient address should contain a username, an @ sign,
       and a fully qualified domain name.

       qqmmaaiill--qquueeuuee always adds a RReecceeiivveedd line to  the  top  of  the  message.
       Other  than this, qqmmaaiill--qquueeuuee does not inspect the message and does not
       enforce any restrictions on  its  contents.   However,  the  recipients
       probably  expect  to  see  a  proper  header,  as  described  in qqmmaaiill--
       hheeaaddeerr((55)).

       _t_a_p_s Should contain regex syntax of email  addresses  to  tap  and  the
            associated  email  address  to  send  the  copy to. The two fields
            should be separated by a colon.

       qqmmaaiill--qquueeuuee imposes two constraints on the queue structure:  each  mmeessss
       subdirectory  must  be in the same filesystem as the ppiidd directory; and
       each ttooddoo subdirectory must be in  the  same  filesystem  as  the  iinnttdd
       directory.

       qqmmaaiill--qquueeuuee  does not print diagnostics.  It exits 0 if it has success‐
       fully queued the message.  It exits between 1 and 99 if it  has  failed
       to queue the message.

       All  qqmmaaiill--qquueeuuee  error  codes  between  11  and  40 indicate permanent
       errors:

       1111   Address too long.

       3311   Mail server permanently refuses to send the message to any recipi‐
            ents.   (Not  used  by  qqmmaaiill--qquueeuuee,  but  can be used by programs
            offering the same interface.)

       All other qqmmaaiill--qquueeuuee error codes indicate temporary errors:

       5511   Out of memory.

       5522   Timeout.

       5533   Write error; e.g., disk full.
