       envelopes - sender/recipient lists attached to messages

       Electronic mail messages are delivered in _e_n_v_e_l_o_p_e_s.

       An  envelope  lists a _s_e_n_d_e_r and one or more _r_e_c_i_p_i_e_n_t_s.  Usually these
       envelope addresses are the same as the addresses listed in the  message
       header:

          (envelope) from djb to root
          From: djb
          To: root

       In more complicated situations, though, the envelope addresses may dif‐
       fer from the header addresses.

       When a message is delivered to several people at  different  locations,
       it is first photocopied and placed into several envelopes:

          (envelope) from djb to root
          From: djb                          Copy #1 of message
          To: root, god@brl.mil

          (envelope) from djb to god@brl.mil
          From: djb                          Copy #2 of message
          To: root, god@brl.mil

       When a message is delivered to several people at the same location, the
       sender doesn’t have to photocopy it.  He can instead stuff it into  one
       envelope  with  several  addresses; the recipients will make the photo‐
       copy:

          (envelope) from djb to god@brl.mil, angel@brl.mil
          From: djb
          To: god@brl.mil, angel@brl.mil, joe, frde

       Bounced mail is sent back to the envelope sender address.  The  bounced
       mail doesn’t list an envelope sender, so bounce loops are impossible:

          (envelope) from <> to djb
          From: MAILER-DAEMON
          To: djb
          Subject: unknown user frde

       The  recipient  of  a message may make another copy and forward it in a
       new envelope:

          (envelope) from djb to joe
          From: djb                          Original message
          To: joe

          (envelope) from joe to fred
          From: djb                          Forwarded message
          To: joe

       A mailing list works almost the same way:

          (envelope) from djb to sos-list
          From: djb                          Original message
          To: sos-list

          (envelope) from sos-owner to god@brl.mil
          From: djb                          Forwarded message
          To: sos-list                       to recipient #1

          (envelope) from sos-owner to frde
          From: djb                          Forwarded message
          To: sos-list                       to recipient #2

       Notice that the mailing list is set up to replace the  envelope  sender
       with something new, ssooss--oowwnneerr.  So bounces will come back to ssooss--oowwnneerr:

          (envelope) from <> to sos-owner
          From: MAILER-DAEMON
          To: sos-owner
          Subject: unknown user frde

       It’s a good idea to set up an extra address, ssooss--oowwnneerr, like this:  the
       original  envelope  sender  (ddjjbb)  has  no  way  to  fix  bad  ssooss--lliisstt
       addresses, and of course bounces must not be sent to ssooss--lliisstt itself.

       Envelope sender and envelope recipient addresses  are  transmitted  and
       recorded in several ways.

       When  a user injects mail through qqmmaaiill--iinnjjeecctt, he can supply a RReettuurrnn--
       PPaatthh line or a --ff option for the envelope sender; by default the  enve‐
       lope sender is his login name.  The envelope recipient addresses can be
       taken from the command line or from various header fields, depending on
       the options to qqmmaaiill--iinnjjeecctt.  Similar comments apply to sseennddmmaaiill.

       When a message is transferred from one machine to another through SMTP,
       the envelope sender is given in  a  MMAAIILL  FFRROOMM  command,  the  envelope
       recipients  are  given in RRCCPPTT TTOO commands, and the message is supplied
       separately by a DDAATTAA command.

       When a message is delivered by  qqmmaaiill  to  a  single  local  recipient,
       qqmmaaiill--llooccaall  records  the  recipient  in  DDeelliivveerreedd--TToo and the envelope
       sender in RReettuurrnn--PPaatthh.  It uses DDeelliivveerreedd--TToo to detect mail  forwarding
       loops.

       sseennddmmaaiill  normally records the envelope sender in RReettuurrnn--PPaatthh.  It does
       not record envelope recipient addresses, on the theory  that  they  are
       redundant:  you  received  the  mail,  so you must have been one of the
       envelope recipients.

       Note that, if the header doesn’t have any recipient addresses, sseennddmmaaiill
       will move envelope recipient addresses back into the header.  This sit‐
       uation occurs if all addresses were originally listed as BBcccc, since BBcccc
       is  automatically  removed.   When sseennddmmaaiill sees this, it creates a new
       AAppppaarreennttllyy--TToo header field with the envelope recipient addresses.  This
       has the strange effect that each blind-carbon-copy recipient will see a
       list of all recipients on the same machine.

       When a message is  stored  in  mmbbooxx  format,  the  envelope  sender  is
       recorded  at  the  top  of  the message as a UUCP-style FFrroomm (no colon)
       line.  Note that this line is less reliable than the  RReettuurrnn--PPaatthh  line
       added by qqmmaaiill--llooccaall or sseennddmmaaiill.
