       qqmmaaiill--llooccaall  will,  upon  your request, feed each incoming mail message
       through a program of your choice.

       When a mail message arrives, qqmmaaiill--llooccaall runs sshh  --cc  _c_o_m_m_a_n_d  in  your
       home  directory.   It makes the message available on _c_o_m_m_a_n_d’s standard
       input.

       WWAARRNNIINNGG:: The mail message  does  not  begin  with  qqmmaaiill--llooccaall’s  usual
       RReettuurrnn--PPaatthh and DDeelliivveerreedd--TToo lines.

       Note  that qqmmaaiill--llooccaall uses the same file descriptor for every delivery
       in your ..qqmmaaiill file, so it is not safe for _c_o_m_m_a_n_d to fork a child that
       reads the message in the background while the parent exits.

EEXXIITT CCOODDEESS
       _c_o_m_m_a_n_d’s  exit  codes  are  interpreted  as  follows: 0 means that the
       delivery was successful; 99 means that the delivery was successful, but
       that  qqmmaaiill--llooccaall  should ignore all further delivery instructions; 100
       means that the delivery failed permanently (hard error); 111 means that
       the  delivery  failed but should be tried again in a little while (soft
       error).

       Currently 64, 65, 70, 76, 77, 78, and 112 are considered  hard  errors,
       and  all  other  codes  are  considered soft errors, but _c_o_m_m_a_n_d should
       avoid relying on this.

       qqmmaaiill--llooccaall supplies several useful environment variables  to  _c_o_m_m_a_n_d.
       WWAARRNNIINNGG::  These environment variables are not quoted.  They may contain
       special characters.  They are under the control of a possibly malicious
       remote user.

       SSEENNDDEERR  is  the  envelope  sender address.  NNEEWWSSEENNDDEERR is the forwarding
       envelope sender address, as described in  ddoott--qqmmaaiill((55)).   RREECCIIPPIIEENNTT  is
       the  envelope  recipient address, _l_o_c_a_l_@_d_o_m_a_i_n.  UUSSEERR is _u_s_e_r.  HHOOMMEE is
       your home directory, _h_o_m_e_d_i_r.  HHOOSSTT is the _d_o_m_a_i_n part of the recipient
       address.   LLOOCCAALL is the _l_o_c_a_l part.  EEXXTT is the address extension, _e_x_t.

       HHOOSSTT22 is the portion of HHOOSSTT preceding the last dot; HHOOSSTT33 is the  por‐
       tion  of HHOOSSTT preceding the second-to-last dot; HHOOSSTT44 is the portion of
       HHOOSSTT preceding the third-to-last dot.

       EEXXTT22 is the portion of EEXXTT following the first dash; EEXXTT33 is  the  por‐
       tion following the second dash; EEXXTT44 is the portion following the third
       dash.  DDEEFFAAUULLTT is the portion corresponding to the ddeeffaauulltt part of  the
       ..qqmmaaiill--...  file name; DDEEFFAAUULLTT is not set if the file name does not end
       with ddeeffaauulltt.

       DDTTLLIINNEE and RRPPLLIINNEE are the usual  DDeelliivveerreedd--TToo  and  RReettuurrnn--PPaatthh  lines,
       including  newlines.   UUFFLLIINNEE  is the UUCP-style FFrroomm__ line that qqmmaaiill--
       llooccaall adds to _m_b_o_x-format files.
