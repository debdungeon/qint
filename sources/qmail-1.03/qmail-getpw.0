       In  qqmmaaiill,  each user controls a vast array of local addresses.  qqmmaaiill--
       ggeettppww finds the user that controls a  particular  address,  _l_o_c_a_l.   It
       prints  six  pieces  of information, each terminated by NUL: _u_s_e_r; _u_i_d;
       _g_i_d; _h_o_m_e_d_i_r; _d_a_s_h; and _e_x_t.  The user’s  account  name  is  _u_s_e_r;  the
       user’s  uid  and gid in decimal are _u_i_d and _g_i_d; the user’s home direc‐
       tory is _h_o_m_e_d_i_r; and  messages  to  _l_o_c_a_l  will  be  handled  by  _h_o_m_e_‐
       _d_i_r//..qqmmaaiill_d_a_s_h_e_x_t.

       In  case  of  trouble,  qqmmaaiill--ggeettppww exits nonzero without printing any‐
       thing.

       WWAARRNNIINNGG:: The operating system’s ggeettppwwnnaamm  function,  which  is  at  the
       heart of qqmmaaiill--ggeettppww, is inherently unreliable: it fails to distinguish
       between temporary errors and nonexistent  users.   Future  versions  of
       ggeettppwwnnaamm  should  return ETXTBSY to indicate temporary errors and ESRCH
       to indicate nonexistent users.

       qqmmaaiill--ggeettppww considers an account in //eettcc//ppaasssswwdd to be a user if (1) the
       account has a nonzero uid, (2) the account’s home directory exists (and
       is visible to qqmmaaiill--ggeettppww), and (3) the account owns  its  home  direc‐
       tory.   qqmmaaiill--ggeettppww ignores account names containing uppercase letters.
       qqmmaaiill--ggeettppww also assumes that all account names  are  shorter  than  32
       characters.

       qqmmaaiill--ggeettppww gives each user control over the basic _u_s_e_r address and all
       addresses of the form _u_s_e_r--_a_n_y_t_h_i_n_g.  When _l_o_c_a_l is _u_s_e_r, _d_a_s_h and  _e_x_t
       are  both empty.  When _l_o_c_a_l is _u_s_e_r--_a_n_y_t_h_i_n_g, _d_a_s_h is a hyphen and _e_x_t
       is _a_n_y_t_h_i_n_g.  _u_s_e_r may appear in any combination of uppercase and  low‐
       ercase letters at the front of _l_o_c_a_l.

       A  catch-all  user,  aalliiaass, controls all other addresses.  In this case
       _e_x_t is _l_o_c_a_l and _d_a_s_h is a hyphen.

       You can override all of qqmmaaiill--ggeettppww’s decisions  with  the  qqmmaaiill--uusseerrss
       mechanism, which is reliable, highly configurable, and much faster than
       qqmmaaiill--ggeettppww.
