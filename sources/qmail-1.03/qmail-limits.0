       qmail-limits - artificial limits in the qmail system

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The  qqmmaaiill  system is able to handle messages of any size, addresses of
       any size, mailing lists of any size, and so on, except  as  limited  by
       the available memory and disk space.

       However, it imposes certain artificial limits:

       1.   qqmmaaiill--llssppaawwnn  silently  limits  the  number  of simultaneous local
            deliveries to 120.  qqmmaaiill--rrssppaawwnn silently  limits  the  number  of
            simultaneous remote deliveries to 120.

       2.   qqmmaaiill--qquueeuuee  rejects  any  message with an envelope address longer
            than 1000 characters.

       3.   qqmmaaiill--llssppaawwnn truncates any overly long error report from a  deliv‐
            ery program.  It appends a note saying that it did so.
