              qqmmaaiill--sseenndd  is unable to prepare itself for delivering messages;
              it is giving up.  This normally indicates a  serious  configura‐
              tion  error,  but  it  can  be  caused  by  a  temporary lack of
              resources.

              because the disk is full.   This  is  a  very  serious  problem;

              qqmmaaiill--sseenndd is going to preprocess a queued message.  The message
              number, _m, is its disk inode number.  After a message is removed
              from the queue, its number can be reused immediately.
