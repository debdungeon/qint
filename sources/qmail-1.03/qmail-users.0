       The  file //vvaarr//qqmmaaiill//uusseerrss//aassssiiggnn assigns addresses to users. For exam‐
       ple,

          =joe.shmoe:joe:503:78:/home/joe:::

       says that mail for jjooee..sshhmmooee should be delivered to user jjooee, with  uid
       503 and gid 78, as specified by //hhoommee//jjooee//..qqmmaaiill.

       Assignments  fed  to qqmmaaiill--nneewwuu will be used by qqmmaaiill--llssppaawwnn to control
       qqmmaaiill--llooccaall’s   deliveries.    See   qqmmaaiill--nneewwuu(8).    A   change    to
       //vvaarr//qqmmaaiill//uusseerrss//aassssiiggnn will have no effect until qqmmaaiill--nneewwuu is run.

       //vvaarr//qqmmaaiill//uusseerrss//aassssiiggnn  is  a series of assignments, one per line.  It
       ends with a line containing a single dot.  Lines must not contain  NUL.

       A simple assignment is a line of the form

          =local:user:uid:gid:homedir:dash:ext:

       Here _l_o_c_a_l is an address; _u_s_e_r, _u_i_d, and _g_i_d are the account name, uid,
       and gid of the user in charge of _l_o_c_a_l; and messages to _l_o_c_a_l  will  be
       controlled by _h_o_m_e_d_i_r//..qqmmaaiill_d_a_s_h_e_x_t.

       If  there  are  several  assignments for the same _l_o_c_a_l address, qqmmaaiill--
       llssppaawwnn will use the first one.

       _l_o_c_a_l is interpreted without regard to case.

       A wildcard assignment is a line of the form

          +loc:user:uid:gid:homedir:dash:pre:

       This assignment applies to any address beginning  with  _l_o_c,  including
       _l_o_c itself.  It means the same as

          =locext:user:uid:gid:homedir:dash:preext:

       for every string _e_x_t.

       A  more  specific wildcard assignment overrides a less specific assign‐
       ment, and a simple assignment overrides any wildcard  assignment.   For
       example:

          +:alias:7790:2108:/var/qmail/alias:-::
          +joe-:joe:507:100:/home/joe:-::
          =joe:joe:507:100:/home/joe:::

       The address jjooee is handled by the third line; the address jjooee--ddiirreecctt is
       handled by the second line; the address bbiillll is handled  by  the  first
       line.
